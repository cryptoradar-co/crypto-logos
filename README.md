# Crypto Logos
This project contains more than 100 icons of leading cryptocurrencies in two distinct styles (thumbnails & logos). All logos are provided as **scalable .svg vector files**.

The files are entirely **free to use**. All we ask for is to attribute us as the author (e.g. by setting a link to [our website](https://cryptoradar.co/) or [this repository](https://github.com/cryptoradar-co/crypto-logos) in the legal statements of your website). 

If an icon that you need is missing, please create a new issue or open a pull request contribution.
